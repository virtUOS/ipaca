  text: "<p> Businesses often sell items for cash as well as on account, where payment terms are extended for a period\
   or time (for example, 30 to 45 days). _1_ . Likewise, businesses often purchase items from suppliers ( also called\
   vendors) for cash or, more likely, on account. Under the cash basis of accounting, these transactions would not be\
   recorded until the cash is exchanged. In contrast, under accrual accounting, the transactions are recorded when the \
  transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is received or paid. <p> \
   </p> Even though we anticipate that companies will be in business 'forever', we are not going to own a company's stock \
   forever. Therefore, the dividend stream to which we would have legal claim is only for that period of the company's \
    life during which we own the stock. We need to modify the dividend model to account for a finite period\
      when we will sell the stock at some future time. _2_ . We will maintain a constant dividend assumption.</p>",
