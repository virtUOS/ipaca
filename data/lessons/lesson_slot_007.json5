  text: "<p> According to most widely accepted models of human memory and cognition, the content stored in people’s brains\
   can be visualized as a network. Meme states (e.g., facts, memories) do not exist in isolation; rather, they are \
   connected to one another. Thus, rather than thinking of memories or knowledge as filed in a mental “drawer”, it is more\
   accurate to think of them as nodes (i.e., connection points) in a web.</p>\
   </p> These connections are created when a meme or meme state is initially learned, or “encoded” into memory, which \
   involves physiological changes in the brain (referred to as memory traces). The number and nature of connections \
   between meme [states] can and does vary. Some meme states have many connections to other meme or meme states, while\
   others have relatively few. For example, you probably have many different meme states (i.e., ideas, concepts, memories)\
   connected to the meme of your hometown. In contrast, you probably have relatively few meme states connected to the\
   meme of Capel, a town in Western Australia (unless that happens to be your hometown!). Generally, it is easier to \
   access meme states that have more connections, as they have more possible paths leading to them.</p>",
