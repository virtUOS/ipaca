            question:  "Read the text and type the correct adjective form <br>\
                        How much do you think you know about poisonous animals? Probably, not too much. <br>\
                        _1_  frogs will be presented to you in this text, luckily not face to face. <br>\
                        That _2_ creature in the picture is the phantasmal poison frog, that can be met in one of _3_corners of the world – Ecuador. <br>\
                        Its other name is a poison dart frog and the reason for this will be explained later. Due to their _4_ natural habitat, this species is considered as endangered or vulnerable according to IUCN. <br>\
                        These frogs tend to live in the leaf litter on the floor of tropical rainforests, particularly near streams and really _5_ areas. <br>\
                        Phantasmals can also be found in banana and cacao plantations, that makes them _6_ for people, who work on these lands. <br>\
                        Coming back to its name, we should have a look at the South American history. <br>\
                        Local pristine tribes used to use the frog’s skin secretion to poison their arrows and darts for hunting which was quite _7_ . <br>\
                        The next issue to be revealed is actually phantasmal’s poison. An _8_ fact about it is that its poison is produced by frog’s diet that consists of _9_ insects and spiders. <br>\
                        Consequently, in zoos dart frogs are not poisonous at all as their diet is controlled. Phantasmal frogs are also known as the _10_ fathers. Male frogs care for eggs and tadpoles, carrying them on their backs for 6-12 weeks. <br>\
                        These cute vivid amphibians, that grow only up to 4 centimeters, can easily enchant you, but be really _11_ with them as it is only 2 micrograms of their poison needed to kill an adult. <br>\
                        According to current data, this species is one of _12_ in the whole world.",  // the question to be displayed
