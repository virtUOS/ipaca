  text: "<p>Over centuries scientists have extracted various scientific laws from countless observations, hypotheses, and experiments. \
        These scientific laws are, in a sense, the 'rules' of the game that nature plays. One remarkable discovery about nature—one that \
        underlies everything you will read about in this text—is that the same laws apply everywhere in the universe. \
        The rules that determine the motion of stars so far away that your eye cannot see them are the same laws that determine the arc \
        of a baseball after a batter has hit it out of the park.</p>\
        <p>Note that without the existence of such universal laws, we could not make much headway in astronomy. If each pocket of the \
        universe had different rules, we would have little chance of interpreting what happened in other 'neighborhoods.' \
        But, the consistency of the laws of nature gives us enormous power to understand distant objects without traveling to them and \
        learning the local laws. In the same way, if every region of a country had completely different laws, it would be very difficult \
        to carry out commerce or even to understand the behavior of people in those different regions. A consistent set of laws, though, \
        allows us to apply what we learn or practice in one state to any other state.</p>\
        <p>This is not to say that our current scientific models and laws cannot change. New experiments and observations can lead to \
        new, more sophisticated models—models that can include new phenomena and laws about their behavior. The general theory of \
        relativity proposed by Albert Einstein is a perfect example of such a transformation that took place about a century ago; it \
        led us to predict, and eventually to observe, a strange new class of objects that astronomers call black holes. Only the \
        patient process of observing nature ever more carefully and precisely can demonstrate the validity of such new scientific models.</p>\
        <p>One important problem in describing scientific models has to do with the limitations of language. When we try to describe \
        complex phenomena in everyday terms, the words themselves may not be adequate to do the job. For example, you may have heard the \
        structure of the atom likened to a miniature solar system. While some aspects of our modern model of the atom do remind us of \
        planetary orbits, many other of its aspects are fundamentally different.</p>\
        <p>This problem is the reason scientists often prefer to describe their models using equations rather than words. \
        In this book, which is designed to introduce the field of astronomy, we use mainly words to discuss what scientists have learned. \
        We avoid complex math, but if this course piques your interest and you go on in science, more and more of your studies will \
        involve the precise language of mathematics.</p>",
