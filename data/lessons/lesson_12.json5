  text: "<p> Open science does not refer to one set of specific rules; instead, it is a collection of several research \
         practices that variously manifest themselves in different research contexts (Corker, 2018). Open science \
         practices are valuable not only because they are transparent but also because they help improve the quality \
         and accumulation of scientific knowledge. The first source highlighted in this paper provides a skilled overview\
         of open science and related topics concerning reproducibility and replicability. </p>\
         <p> The credibility of evidence depends in part on its reproducibility; given the same quantitative evidence \
         (i.e., data) and the same statistical analysis, can the same result be obtained? The credibility of scientific\
         claims also depends in part on their replicability; if an experiment is repeated with the same procedures, \
         therefore generating new data, will the same result be obtained? Neither reproducibility nor replicability can \
         be evaluated without both transparency and accessibility of the research process and the evidence generated \
         from it. Thus, open science practices are crucial to the most basic aspects of the scientific process.</p>",
