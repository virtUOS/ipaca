  text: "<p>A long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) research is to devise cognitive systems that exhibit the \
  capability of abstract reasoning, thus far deemed a distinctive characteristic of human intelligence. Not only is this\
  a quest to improve our understanding of the nature of intelligence, but also may enable AI to assist humans in solving\
  abstract complex tasks of repetitive nature or scale beyond the grasp of humans. In recent years, as deep learning has\
  become more prominent, machine learning models have outperformed humans in several fields, including image classification\
  and playing strategic games, albeit relying on unsustainably increasing model sizes. The energy requirements of these\
  models are in stark contrast to ≈20 W required by the human brain, whose principles of operation may provide crucial\
  inspiration for improvements in AI, reducing the environmental footprint of existing solutions and enabling new low-power\
  applications at the edge. Moreover, taking inspiration from the brain's operation during versatile tasks, such as those\
  where abstract or relational reasoning capabilities are required, will pave the way for the development of novel and \
  valuable AI architectures. The interest in demonstrating applicability of artificial neural networks for reasoning has\
  recently grown as more demanding tasks are being considered and large datasets are being created.</p> \
  <p>Another important class of tasks requiring analytic intelligence is the so-called visual oddity, first introduced \
  as part of a neuroscientific experiment to study the knowledge of core conceptual principles of geometry. This specific\
  visual oddity task is defined on geometrical objects and consists of 45 distinct riddles designed to discover which\
  basic concepts of geometry such as points, lines, parallelism, and symmetry, are understood by the participants of the\
  study. Each riddle contains six frames, five of which include a geometrical concept being tested. One of the frames \
  violates the geometrical concept and is called the oddity. The goal is to classify which one of the six frames is the\
  oddity. The task was originally presented to two different groups of people: Americans and Munduruku, an Amazonian \
  indigenous group. Individual riddle accuracies of both groups were recorded for children and adults. The results showed\
  no significant difference in accuracies between the American and the Munduruku children. This suggests that the core\
  knowledge of geometry required for solving the abstract problem of the visual oddity tasks is accessible to children \
  also in the absence of schooling and experience with graphic symbols and geometrical terms. Simultaneously, while the \
  results of Munduruku adults remained indistinguishable from those of Munduruku children, educated American adults scored\
  significantly higher. The participants from the Munduruku population solved on average 66.8% riddles, performing well\
  with the core concepts of topology, Euclidean geometry, and basic geometrical figures. Recognizing the oddity within \
  geometrical transformations turned out to be significantly more challenging, thus suggesting that such transformations\
  may represent inherently more difficult concepts that through the process of education become accessible to American\
  adults solving ≈84.8% riddles. These results render the visual oddity task as an appealing abstract reasoning task to\
  assess the accessibility of the visual abstract concepts in AI systems.</p> \
  <p>As mentioned earlier, the visual oddity task evaluates the capability of making analogies by relying on geometric \
  concepts such as points, lines, and angles. Therefore, the detection of similarities is key to solving the riddles. \
  For humans, abstract reasoning is crucial to find a correct answer, as no two images are the same and there are several\
  ways to detect an odd image. In fact, to succeed, the participants must infer the geometrical relationship between the\
  array of images. Therefore, the challenge for neural networks lies in whether they can infer the abstract geometrical\
  relationships between the images. Training different neural network architectures to solve the visual oddity task\
  provides an insight into their relation-forming capabilities.</p>",
