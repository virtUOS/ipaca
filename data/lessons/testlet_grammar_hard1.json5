  text: "<p>Art is a highly diverse range of human activities engaged in creating visual, auditory, or performed artifacts — artworks — \
        that express the author's imaginative or technical skill, and are intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.</p>\
        <p>The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include images or objects in fields like painting, sculpture, \
        printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the \
        decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential, in a way that they \
        usually are not in another visual art, like a painting.</p>\
        <p>Despite the seemingly indefinable nature of art, there have always existed certain formal guidelines for its aesthetic \
        judgment and analysis. Formalism is a concept in art theory in which an artwork's artistic value is determined solely by \
        its form, or how it is made.</p>\
        <p>Art is often examined through the interaction of the principles and elements of art. The principles of art include movement, \
        unity, harmony, variety, balance, contrast, proportion and pattern. The elements include texture, form, space, shape, color, \
        value and line.</p>\",
