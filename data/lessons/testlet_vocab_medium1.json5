  text: "<p>No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly \
        and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their \
        various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise \
        the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this \
        globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria \
        under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought \
        of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental \
        habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to \
        themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours \
        are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, \
        and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.</p>\
        <p>The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and \
        the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular \
        hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must \
        have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling \
        to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated \
        existence.</p>",
