  text: "<p>By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy appears\
          relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, European economies have had unemployment rates hovering \
          near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because \
          recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions underlying supply and demand for \
          labor have been different rope, in a way that has created a much higher natural rate of unemployment.</p>\
          </p>Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with \
          nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have laws\
          that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance\
          or retraining packages after laying them off. However, when companies know that it will be difficult to fire or\
          lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.</p>\
         </p>Should we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count \
          children as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college students\
          have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of\
          unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on parental \
          leave.</p>",
