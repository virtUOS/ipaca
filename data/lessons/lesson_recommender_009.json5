        <p>The Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of both violent and non-violent demonstrations, protests, riots, coups, and civil wars in North Africa and the Middle East that _1_. The Tunisian Revolution effect spread strongly to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.</p>\
        <p>Analysts have pointed to a number of complex factors behind the movement, including issues such _2_, and a number of demographic structural factors, such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth.</p>\
        <p>In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention has been focused _3_ in allowing citizens to bypass state-operated media channels.</p>\
        <p>Facebook, Twitter, and other major social media played _4_. Nine out of ten Egyptians and Tunisians responded to a poll that they used Facebook to organize protests and spread awareness. In Egypt, young men referred to themselves as “the Facebook generation.” Furthermore, 28% of Egyptians and 29% of Tunisians from the same poll said that blocking Facebook greatly hindered and/or disrupted communication. During the protests, people created pages on Facebook to raise awareness about alleged crimes against humanity, such as police brutality in the Egyptian Revolution.</p>",
