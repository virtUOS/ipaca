  text: "Mass gathering events are a major risk factor for the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 pandemic. The role of mass gathering events in the global outbreak of the disease has been proved in several countries. According to the World Health Organization, mass gatherings can be defined as \u201cevents attended by a sufficient number of people to strain the planning and response resources of a community, state or nation\u201d. The Hajj (pilgrimage), the yearly pilgrimage to the holiest city of Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and one of the five pillars of the Islamic creed represents the largest annual mass gathering worldwide. During the Hajj event, pilgrims perform rituals and prayers in mass in some predefined indoor and outdoor spaces, often in very crowded conditions sometimes up to six persons per square meter; under these conditions, respiratory infectious diseases could easily affect a large percent of pilgrims.",
