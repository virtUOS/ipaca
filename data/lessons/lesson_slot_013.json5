  text: "<p> A. Database management systems must provide the ability to define and enforce certain constraints to ensure\
         that users enter valid information and maintain data integrity. A database constraint is a restriction or rule\
         that dictates what can be entered or edited in a table such as a postal code using a certain format or adding\
         a valid city in the City field. There are many types of database constraints. Data type, for example,\
         determines the sort of data permitted in a field, for example numbers only. Data uniqueness such as the primary\
         key ensures that no duplicates are entered. Constraints can be simple (field based) or complex (programming).</p>\
         <p> B. Not all users of a database system will have the same accessing privileges. For example, one user might\
         have read-only access (i.e., the ability to read a file but not make changes), while another might have read\
         and write privileges, which is the ability to both read and modify a file. For this reason, a database\
         management system should provide a security subsystem to create and control different types of user accounts \
         and restrict unauthorized access. </p>\
         <p> C. Another advantage of a database management system is how it allows for data independence. In other words,\
         the system data descriptions or data describing data (metadata) are separated from the application programs. \
         This is possible because changes to the data structure are handled by the database management system and are \
         not embedded in the program itself. </p>",
