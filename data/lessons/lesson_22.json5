  text: "<p>Against our expectations, participants exhibited only slight impairment when intercepting second-order motion\
  targets without looking directly at them. We initially hypothesized that hand movements could become accurate when \
  accompanied by an eye movement as that would allow for a better analysis of the second order-motion target. However,\
  the difference in the results obtained in the Isolated Eye and Isolated Hand movement conditions opens interesting \
  additional possibilities for coordinated eye and hand movements: will the pattern of results be the same when executing\
  coordinated rather than isolated eye and hand movements, or is there an interaction between the two movements that could\
  help improve eye movements accuracy? Results show that indeed, the pattern of results is qualitatively comparable for\
  isolated and combined movements. Movement latencies were again longer for second- compared to first-order motion \
  targets, and also clearly longer for hand than for eye movements. Regarding movement endpoints, we also observed a \
  similar pattern to the one presented in the Isolated Eye and Isolated Hand movements conditions. When moving towards \
  first-order motion targets, both eye and hand movements landed close to the actual position of the target. However, \
  when aiming at second-order motion targets saccades still landed closer to the position where targets were 100 ms \
  before movement offset but hand movements were accurate. </p>",
