  text: "<p>Music is an auditory or aural art form that can be represented visually with notation. \
   Think about what it’s like to translate one language to another. It can be a challenging task—a direct word-for-word \
   translation isn’t always possible or useful, so a translator needs to think about how best to \
   communicate to the reader. Similarly, writing down sounds involves making decisions about what needs to be communicated \
   and how. No system of notation could capture every aspect of sound in full detail And still be useful or readable, so \
   only some musical elements can be depicted. Despite this, there are several advantages to written musical notation: \
   a written musical work does not need to be memorized, and details can be recorded that might otherwise be forgotten. \
   Additionally, written notation makes musical works accessible to more people, since anyone who knows the notation \
   system can learn a notated work on their own without the help of a teacher. Imagine inventing a way to write down a \
   tfavorite song or musical work so that a musician could perform It without ever having heard it before.</p>",
