  text: "<p> Physical activity and personality \
         One personal factor that has received much attention and has the potential for broad reaching \
         adaptations to current physical activity theory and practice is personality. Currently the \
         cumulative evidence supports a modest relationship between personality and physical activity. \
         In particular, self-reported physical activity has a reliable, yet small positive association with \
         Extroversion and Conscientiousness and a small negative relationship with Neuroticism. Much of the \
         research to support these relationships is cross-sectional, yet there is a growing evidence base to \
         show that personality can affect physical activity over time using longitudinal designs. \
         Interestingly, some evidence even supports a beneficial effect of physical activity on personality \
         change over time. \
         How personality may influence physical activity has also seen considerable research attention. There \
         is a body of evidence that personality traits may play a role in social cognitive constructs such as \
         attitudes, enjoyment, self-efficacy, barriers/motives, and intention. Conscientiousness, in \
         particular, has been shown to influence whether people are likely to follow through with intentions, \
         and may contribute to what is known as the intention-behavior gap. Personality is also linked to physical \
         activity choices and preferences. For example, it has been established that higher intensity aerobic \
         activities are more likely to be performed by extroverts. The relationships between general symptoms of \
         mental distress and physical activity are dependent on personality characteristics. Individuals with \
         personality profiles that put them at higher risk for mental distress may benefit from greater levels \
         of fitness and physical activity participation. Less work has been done among populations with clinical \
         mental disorders, which are frequently comorbid with chronic illness, highlighting the need for continued \
         work in this direction. \
         Finally, research is starting to explore how personality may be used to improve physical activity \
         interventions. Associations between personality and physical activity represent a potentially challenging \
         obstacle rather than a target for change. Thus, health promoters may need to consider interventions \
         adapted to personality to maximize program reach and effectiveness. \
         In summary, much evidence exists on the relationships between personality and physical activity, though \
         more work is required to understand genetic, cognitive, and affective mechanisms, developmental \
         associations across extended periods of time, and the development and implementation of personality \
         adapted physical activity promotion strategies.</p>",
