            question: "<strong>Tips for newly employed</strong> <br>\
                        You have got a job of an office worker and tomorrow is going to be your first day of working in a new team? If so, we suggest you the tips that might be helpful. <br>\
                        Firstly, you should establish relations with your boss. He/she is _1_ ; therefore, your career development and salary will directly depend on him/her. <br>\
                        Secondly, you should recognize _2_ in the team. It is usually a person who has worked there for a long time and is a real expert. Such worker could help you to settle in a new place and bring you up to speed. You will be lucky if he/she turns to be an altruist who is always ready to help. This means that if you ask a question, your coworker will try to answer _3_ . At the same time be ready to meet the person who always _4_ so when you ask him/her for help, your colleague will definitely say that he/she must do something else and cannot solve your problem now. <br>\
                        Thirdly, it is not excluded that all the members of the team will not be kind, easy-going and helpful so you may need to choose the person who is _5_ and build relationships with him/her. <br>\
                        The main thing is to remember that the first impression can be deceptive and perhaps a person, who seemed to be completely different from you, will become your friend _6_ . ",
