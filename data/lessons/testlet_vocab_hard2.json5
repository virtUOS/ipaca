  text: "<p>Culture is a system of learned behavior patterns that are characteristic of the members of a society (Hoebel, 1958). \
        Note the emphasis on the learning of behaviors or ways of doing things. Culture is learned, and individuals learn culture \
        through an ongoing process of socialization. Parents, families, schools, peers, and workplaces, for example, all socialize \
        individuals to ways of doing things. We find differences across cultures in dress, language, food preferences, and other \
        behaviors in part because these are learned behaviors — not knowledge that is innate, instinctual, or determined by genetic programming.</p>\
        <p>Cultural patterns are characteristic behaviors and often include a complex array of choices. A culture may afford more than \
        one way of doing the same thing. Hence, diversity in behaviors may be found in some aspects of any culture.</p>\
        <p>Culture is a complex whole that includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and \
        habits that members of a society acquire (Linton, 1936). Linton emphasized that culture is a complex whole — a network of \
        behaviors related to all aspects of life. Dress is shaped by and reflects many characteristics in any culture, so dress is \
        a complex map of cultural characteristics.</p>\",
