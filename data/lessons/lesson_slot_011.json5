  text: "<p> The 4 Connections is a research-based equity producing framework that focuses on building intentional \
  relationships between students and faculty in ways that increase the number of student completions, reduce equity gaps,\
  and ensure the quality of student learning. It identifies foundational principles faculty with high completion rates \
  use to dramatically improve the quality of students' experiences in and outside the classroom: Interact with Students\
  by Name, Check-In Regularly, Schedule 1-to-1 Meetings, Practice Paradox. _1_. Therefore, educators in this faculty \
  learning community met frequently to learn from and with each other.  In addition to creating a shared understanding \
  of each of the 4 Connections, members of this FLC intentionally developed the trust and mutual respect necessary to \
  share the challenges and barriers they experienced. _2_. Along with improved completion rates in their courses, many \
  members reported experiencing a renewed passion for their work, which they credited to the rejuvenating power of the\
  relationships they created with their colleagues in the FLC and, of course, with their students! </p>",
