Since Florence Nightingale introduced nursing as an art, several theorists have emphasized the aesthetic aspect of nursing in their literature. However, many experts believe that the word \"art\" has been accepted in nursing without deep thought and criticism.To judge the statement: \"Nursing is an art\", it seems that it is necessary to review the similarities and differences of \"art\" concept in nursing and other fields literature. Art has a complex and multidimensional meaning that is the backbone of many theories presented; however, they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Nursing has artistic properties but this characteristic is referred to as folk art and not to specific features of art. In comparing these theories with the concept of art used in nursing, it is essential to note that art in nursing refers to skills of nursing. In other words, nursing is not a kind of fine art.From the aesthetic perspective, nursing can be easily defined as a form of art however, we must put great importance in the inseparable words of \"aesthetic\" and \"art of nursing\". With such a connection, we are able to introduce and capture the true spirit of both art and nursing.", text_source: "dfhdrhdrh", text_licence: "cc", text_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/backstage/lesson/automatic_create", tasks: [{name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: From what perspective can nursing be easily defined as a form of art?", answer: ["a", "e", "s", "t", "h", "e", "t", "i", "c", " ", "p", "e", "r", "s", "p", "e", "c", "t", "i", "v", "e"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What do we capture in the words \"aesthetic\" and \"art of nursing\"?", answer: ["t", "r", "u", "e", " ", "s", "p", "i", "r", "i", "t"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What aspect of nursing has been emphasized by theorists?", answer: ["a", "e", "s", "t", "h", "e", "t", "i", "c", " ", "a", "s", "p", "e", "c", "t"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: Who introduced nursing as an art?", answer: ["f", "l", "o", "r", "e", "n", "c", "e"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What is the term for nursing's artistic properties?", answer: ["f", "o", "l", "k", " ", "a", "r", "t"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What is nursing not a kind of?", answer: ["f", "i", "n", "e", " ", "a", "r", "t", ".", "f", "r", "o", "m"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What do we place in the words \"aesthetic\" and \"art of nursing\"?", answer: ["g", "r", "e", "a", "t", " ", "i", "m", "p", "o", "r", "t", "a", "n", "c", "e"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What is the term used to describe the acceptance of the word \"art\" in nursing?", answer: ["c", "r", "i", "t", "i", "c", "i", "s", "m", ".", "t", "o", " ", "j", "u", "d", "g", "e"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What kind of meaning does art have?", answer: ["m", "u", "l", "t", "i", "d", "i", "m", "e", "n", "s", "i", "o", "n", "a", "l", " ", "m", "e", "a", "n", "i", "n", "g"]}, {name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What is the other field of nursing that is considered to be an art?", answer: ["f", "i", "e", "l", "d", "s", " ", "l", "i", "t", "e", "r", "a", "t", "u", "r", "e"]}]}
