  text: "<p>Tinnitus is a common and distressing auditory symptom that affects individuals across various age groups and\
  populations. It is characterized by the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, and it can \
  significantly impact an individual's quality of life.</p>\
  <p> The recent increase in internet usage has made medical information more accessible to individuals with tinnitus, \
  with YouTube emerging as a popular and convenient source for obtaining medical information. YouTube is a \
  video-based social media platform that has gained tremendous popularity due to its open environment that allows interactive \
  communication, and is currently ranked as the second most commonly accessed website with an estimated 30 million users \
  accessing it on a daily basis. In South Korea as well, according to an update from Google's advertising resources, as \
  of early 2023, the number of YouTube users in South Korea was estimated at 46 million, representing 88.8% of the total \
  population. A recent systematic review postulated that YouTube has emerged as a platform for promoting unscientific\
  therapies and drugs that lack approval from appropriate regulatory processes. Likewise, although the number of YouTube\
  videos about tinnitus has increased significantly, the reliability and accuracy of these videos have not been thoroughly\
  evaluated, indicating a need for careful assessment of the information presented by YouTube.</p>\
  <p> Various medical information is being provided through YouTube videos, and patients can easily access these video \
  clips. In the otolaryngology fields, the educational benefit of YouTube videos about cholesteatoma, tonsillectomy, \
  ventilation tubes for serous otitis media, rhinoplasty, and thyroid cancer had been examined. A recent study analyzing\
  YouTube videos related to cholesteatoma revealed that the educational level of these videos was extremely low, and the\
  content was reported to lack evidence-based information. Regarding pediatric tonsillectomy, there was a range of\
  information available from highly valuable to unhelpful or misleading. It is noteworthy that anecdotal evidence of\
  unproven alternative therapies and biased negative reporting of medically proven therapies are widely available to \
  patients with YouTube videos, and if they rely solely on this information to make decisions on treatment, significant\
  safety consequences may ensue. And previous studies also postulated that physicians need to be aware of the possible \
  impact these video websites may have on patient perceptions.</p>",
