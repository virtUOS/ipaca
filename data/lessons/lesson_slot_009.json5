  text: "<p>Training is invaluable and often required in most industries. To stay competitive,\
    leadership must be focused on keeping their employees up-to-date on the latest industry standards\
     and compliant with new regulations. Companies know that it takes time to train employees and time\
      is money. However, many companies do not invest enough time in allowing their employees to be strong\
      digital learners which leads to consequences in the workplace, such as, uninformed workers causing costly\
      workplace errors.</p> \
    <p>The benefits of digital learning for employers are vast, depending on how they choose/allow the use of\
          this type of education. It is a cost-effective benefit as a one-time investment in a digital training course,\
           and can add training for their entire workforce while supplying consistent information to all employees.\
            For example, by utilizing computer-based trainings or videos for newly hired employees, companies can provide\
             training with little effort, consistent messages, and on-demand learning as needed, saving the company money and time.\
              The result is a well-prepared workforce ready to do the job at hand with the latest industry knowledge.</p>\
    <p>The old-school way of training employees is to put them in a classroom and show a slide presentation while droning on\
     about the material. Many companies still invest in this type of learning as they feel it works for them. However, employees\
      do not find it interesting enough to pay attention and the instructors grow tired of teaching the same material over and over.\
       Another traditional way of educating workers is on-the-job training (OJT). Although this can be far more valuable than classroom training,\
        OJT is not often consistent. One mentor may teach how he would do the job while another may show a completely different way.\
         Digital learning addresses these issues of consistency and helps ensure a systematic way of learning for new and existing employees.</p>",
