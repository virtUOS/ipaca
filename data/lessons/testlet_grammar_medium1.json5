  text: "<p>Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.\
        The register of his burial was signed by the church, the clerk, the undertaker, \
        and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge’s name was good for \
        anything he chose to put his hand to.</p>\
        <p>Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</p>\
        <p>Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? \
        Scrooge and he were business partners for I don’t know how many years. \
        Scrooge was his only administrator, his only friend, his only mourner.</p>\
        <p>Scrooge never painted out old Marley’s name, however. There it yet was, \
        years afterwards, above the warehouse door — Scrooge and Marley. The firm was \
        known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called him \
        Scrooge, and sometimes they called him Marley. He answered to both names. \
        It was all the same to him.</p>\
        <p>Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, that Scrooge! a \
        squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! \
        External heat and cold had little influence on him. No warmth could warm him, \
        and no cold could cool him. No wind that blew was more bitter than he. Foul \
        weather didn’t know what to do with him. The heaviest rain and snow and hail \
        and sleet could brag of the advantage over him in only one respect — they often \
        “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.</p>\
        <p>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with friendly looks, “My \
        dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars asked \
        Scrooge for a few coins; no children asked him what time it was; no man or \
        woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place. But \
        what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked.</p>\",
