  text: "<p> To address low standards of reporting, the ARRIVE (Animals in Research: Reporting In VivoExperiments)\
   guidelines for reporting were published in 2010. The ARRIVE guidelines are summarized by a 20 item checklist that\
   includes reporting of measures associated with bias (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, data handling).\
   Over 1000 journals have responded to publication of the guidelines by linking to it on their websites and in their\
   instructions to authors.</p>\
   <p> To our knowledge, there have been no studies comparing reporting standards between journals classified as ARRIVE \
   guideline supporters and non-supporters. We hypothesized that papers published in supporting journals would have \
   greater adherence to the guidelines, and therefore higher reporting standards, than those published in non-supporting\
   journals. Additionally, we hypothesized that papers published in supporting journals would show a greater improvement \
   in reporting standards since the guidelines became available. To test these hypotheses, the related subjects of \
   anesthetic and analgesic efficacy and animal welfare were selected for study.</p>\
   <p> Following a change in editorial policy in 2013, the Nature research journals now require that authors accompany\
   accepted manuscripts with a completed checklist identifying inclusion of key items associated with quality of \
   reporting and study design. This checklist has numerous items in common with those of the ARRIVE guidelines. In \
   reviewing approximately 440 papers in each of two groups (those published in the Nature publishing journals and those\
   from other publishers, before and after checklist implementation), the positive effect of the checklist was evident in \
   that reporting of bias criteria (randomization, blinding, sample size calculation and data handling) improved \
   significantly from 0 to 16.4%.</p>",
