  text: "<p>Widespread use of the internet by learners of all ages has democratized the development and accessibility of\
  educational materials. The COVID-19 pandemic further solidified digital communication as a primary medium for information \
  exchange among educators and learners. Indeed, K-12 students are digital natives who use various online platforms such\
  as YouTube to complete academic assignments, with varying degrees of judgement for the reliability of the sources. The\
  amount of time children eight years old or less spent on YouTube has doubled between 2017 and 2020, portending an\
  increased reliance on online media for even the youngest learners. Social media and other online information sources \
  have also facilitated lifelong education for continued professional and personal development. However, the proliferation\
  of misinformation on social media and other platforms raises the risk of exposure to deliberately misleading educational\
  content.</p> \
  <p>The consequences of exposure to online misinformation range in severity and scale, often depending on context. While\
  many types of misinformation exist outside of the mainstream, misinformation on science, technology, engineering, and\
  math (STEM) related topics such as climate change and vaccines have had major public policy repercussions. Social media\
  and modern communication methods facilitate the rapid dissemination of misinformation, amplifying these impacts. \
  Misinformation campaigns tend to rely on undermining the consensus, highlighting uncertainty, undermining the credibility\
  of leading figures and institutions, and disseminating pseudoscientific alternatives.</p> \
  <p>The availability of open-source artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has significantly lowered the barriers to \
  altering videos and images in order to produce highly realistic, manipulated digital content (e.g., deepfakes). Generative \
  neural networks (GNNs) are a class of deep neural network models that represent the state-of-the-art technique that can\
  be leveraged to democratize the mass synthesis of manipulated digital content. They have been used to fabricate images \
  by training them to encode human features, to manipulate images via replacing specific components of a digital image or\
  video, and to create videos via animation of a still image with the characteristics of a source video. </p>",
