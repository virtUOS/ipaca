  text: "<p>Despite the fact that chatbots today can demonstrate remarkable human-like qualities, their effectiveness is\
  significantly reduced when the human end-user becomes aware that they are interacting with a machine and not a human. \
  Why would this be the case? First, people penalize algorithms, a form of machine intelligence, more than humans when \
  errors are committed, which in turn deteriorates the extent to which a person is willing to rely on the algorithm over\
  time. As chatbots are bound to display service failures at one point or another, it follows that the human end-users\
  will penalize the chatbots more severely when compared with a human operator, reducing the customers’ willingness to \
  cooperate with it. In further support of our line of reasoning, other research has also shown that humans have a tendency\
  in general to trust other humans more than they trust machines, and that the more trust customers are willing to give, \
  the more effective the communication that takes place will be. Therefore, when it comes to service provision, humans \
  prefer human agents over machine-based agents, and this is particularly true when they inevitably err.</p>\
  <p>All of this suggests that when the technology is at a level where chatbots are indistinguishable from humans, \
  organizations will face a strong temptation to deceive their customers. As the example of LaMDA illustrates, this stage\
  of technological sophistication is a reality. As such, organizations are now in a position to hide from their customers\
  that chatbots are handling their customer inquiries. Such an approach is obviously problematic because deceiving \
  customers, if found out, is likely to bounce back and result in customers evaluating the organization in negative ways.\
  Of course, any organization will prefer to foster positive customer perceptions, but the fact that automating service \
  delivery has the enormous potential to bring significant financial gains may motivate acts of deception, nonetheless. \
  As such, deceptive tactics have the potential to harm the reputation of the organization, possibly beyond repair. It is \
  therefore crucial for organizations to understand how customers will react when the deceptive use of chatbots is revealed. \
  In this research, we capture the reputation of an employee and organization through perceptions of trust and ethics, \
  as trustworthiness and perceived ethicality are critical inputs when judgments about a person/organization’s reputation\
  are formed. In addition, we define reputational consequences as behavioral outcomes that result from the negative \
  reputation (unethical and untrustworthy) of an employee/organization. We focus explicitly on employees’ desire to leave \
  the organization  and recruiters’ hiring decisions as reputational consequences of deceptive chatbot use. </p> \
  <p>Understanding how an organization’s potential customer base reacts to deceptive chatbot use is critically important\
  for the organization’s reputation. Additionally, choosing not to disclose the use of a chatbot is an act of deception\
  and although there are a myriad of ways in which trust can be violated, deception is a particularly potent way to do\
  this. Of course, organizations that deceive will wish that their transgressions are not known publicly, but these\
  acts — for example due to whistleblowing — can become public knowledge. When these deceptive actions become public \
  knowledge, this has been shown to negatively affect relationships, trigger retaliatory responses, and produce negative\
  emotions. And, although research shows that reparations can be made when trust has been violated, a violation of trust\
  that involves intentional deception has been shown to produce an enduring harm to trust which may well be beyond repair.</p>",
