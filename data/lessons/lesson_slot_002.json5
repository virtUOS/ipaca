  text: "<p>Probability is the mathematical theory used to study uncertainty. It provides tools for the formalization \
         and quantification of the notion of uncertainty. In particular, it deals with the chance of an event \
         occurring. For example, if the different potential outcomes of an experiment are equally likely to occur \
         then the probability of each outcome is taken to be one divided by the number of potential outcomes.</p>\
         <p>As an illustration, consider tossing a fair coin. There are two possible outcomes – a head or a tail – \
         and the probability of each outcome is 1/2. If you toss a fair coin 4 times, the outcomes may not necessarily \
         be 2 heads and 2 tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to \
         2,000 heads and 2,000 tails. It is very unlikely to obtain more than 2,060 tails and it is similarly \
         unlikely to obtain less than 1,940 tails. This is consistent with the expected theoretical probability \
         of heads in any one toss. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular \
         pattern of outcomes when the number of repetitions is large. Statistics exploits this pattern regularity \
         in order to make extrapolations from the observed sample to the entire population.</p>\
         <p>In statistics, we generally want to study a population. If you wished to compute the overall grade \
         point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. \
         The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages.</p>\
         <p>From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that is a property of \
         the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math \
         classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of \
         the term is an example of a statistic. Two words that come up often in statistics are average and \
         proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtained scores of 86, 75, and \
         92, you calculate your average score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your \
         average score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students \
         and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is 22/40 and the proportion \
         of women students is 18/40.</p>",
