  text: "<p>Puberty can be a difficult time for adolescents, but it is important for both parents and adolescents to \
  understand what is happening chemically and physically during puberty. The better kids understand what is really\
  happening to their bodies, the better they are going to be able to handle it and make the most out of a potentially \
  difficult time. Parents can play a huge role in how their kids view puberty and how they are going to handle it.\
  Knowing chemically what hormones are and how they affect the body can be important because it explains what the body \
  is really going through as it is making these changes. Children and parents do not need to know every little effect \
  that all the hormones might have throughout the body but having a basic understanding can help them be able to better\
  respond to their situation. </p>\
  </p>Parents need to be able to communicate this with their children which can be difficult because it is an awkward \
  conversation and also they don’t have the same context of puberty as compared to adults. They don’t have the same \
  context because they haven’t experienced it or been aware of what is happening when they have interacted with older \
  kids experiencing it themselves. Another reason why it can be hard for parents to teach kids about puberty is that \
  they probably have never heard of a hormone and didn’t know that the body had a whole list of chemicals that have a \
  whole list of functions and properties. </p>",
