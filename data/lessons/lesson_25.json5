        question: "<p><b>Choose the option that applies</b>:</p>\
        <p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by the fear of negative evaluation by others and a fear of public\
        embarrassment or humiliation. For people suffering from social anxiety disorder, public speaking is highly anxiety-evoking\
        and is typically avoided. Fear of public speaking, however, is also common in non-clinical samples and has been \
        correlated with decreased public speaking performance. Exposure to public speaking as a component of cognitive \
        behavioral therapy is an effective treatment of social anxiety and the fear of public speaking. However, as \
        mentioned above, opportunities for public speaking may be difficult to realize within a therapeutic session. \
        Therefore, Virtual Reality exposure therapy has been suggested as a tool to present reproducible and controlled \
        public speaking situations in virtuo. While several studies have demonstrated that VRET can be an effective treatment\
        for SAD and the fear of public speaking, there are still mixed results regarding the question whether exposure in \
        virtuo can be as effective as exposure in vivo. _1_. For instance, Owens and Beidel found that giving a speech \
        in front of a virtual audience compared to a real audience elicited less physiological arousal, while another \
        study found similar physiological reactions between real and virtual public speaking scenarios. \
        Differential reactions towards real-world and VR scenarios could also be linked to presence, i.e. the feeling of\
        being in a virtual environment, and more specifically social presence, i.e. the feeling of being in the virtual \
        environment together with other persons. A recent study demonstrated that social presence influenced the degree \
        to which audience behavior affected participants’ emotional experience in a public speaking scenario. Overall, \
        VRET can be effective in the treatment of SAD fear of public speaking, but more studies are required to investigate\
        the contributing mechanisms.</p>\
        <p> The audience is the most important component of every public speaking situation. Audience behavior, i.e.\
        visual or auditory reactions of the audience, serve as a social feedback for the person giving the speech and can\
        be seen as an evaluation of a speaker’s performance. The evaluative nature of audience behavior makes it also \
        highly relevant with respect to the fear of public speaking. Previous studies have investigated which behaviors \
        are linked to specific characteristics of a virtual audience. Using both screen-based as well as immersive \
        paradigms, several nonverbal cues could be identified that are linked to particular audience attitudes. These \
        studies demonstrate that manipulating behavior influences perceived engagement and valence of a virtual audience.\
        Another line of research has focused on the effects that such audience behaviors evoke in the speaker. A VR study \
        compared supportive, neutral, and unsupportive audience behavior and found that fear of public speaking was mostly\
        influenced by unsupportive (i.e. disinterested) audience behavior. _2_. The latter finding was interpreted by the\
        authors in terms of an increase in speakers’ effort that was triggered by the positive audience feedback. It \
        remains unclear whether supportive audience behavior in Virtual Reality might be less effective in realizing the\
        feeling of a positive social evaluation indicated by a supportive audience. On a perceptual level, however, \
        speakers seem to be able to differentiate supportive and unsupportive audience behavior in VR. </p>\ ",
