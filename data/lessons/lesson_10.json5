  text: "<p>The timing and frequency at which exercisers are asked to report their affective responses during exercise\
         can profoundly influence the interpretations of those collecting the measurements. For example, analyses of \
         affective responses only prior to and following exercise often suggest that people 'feel better' after exercise,\
         regardless of the intensity of exercise. However, when affective responses are also collected during exercise,\
         it becomes clear that how one feels during exercise is far from universal. Many exercisers report increased \
         pleasure (or less displeasure) during low-to moderate-intensity exercise. In contrast, when exercise moves\
         beyond moderate intensity, some exercisers report feeling better, while others report feeling worse.</p> \
         <p>Finally, when exercise intensity is near maximal, most exercisers report feeling worse. However, regardless \
         of how the exercisers reported feeling during exercise, within a very short time after ceasing near -maximal -\
         intensity exercise (i.e., seconds to minutes), many people exhibit an 'affective rebound', where they report\
         feeling better. As it turns out, one of the most common maxims of exercise science, that 'exercise makes people\
         feel better', may be partly attributable to suboptimal measurement timing and frequency. Importantly,\
         practitioners who assume that affective responses to exercise are universal may create situations where their\
         clients experience increasing displeasure during exercise but report feeling better afterwards simply because\
         the unpleasant exercise experience has finished. If these and similar instances of displeasure during exercise\
         are experienced repeatedly, it may reduce the probability that the exerciser continues to adhere.</p>  \
         <p>Therefore, to achieve a clearer understanding of the affective responses to exercise of a client, we \
         recommend that measurement of affective responses occurs frequently before, during, and after exercise.</p>",

    <p><b>In this lesson you will:</b>\
    <p>Extend your background knowledge of kinesiology\
    <p>Study up on the topic of Position of Adverbs\
    <p>Keep working  on words and word combinations widely used in academic discourse\
    <p style='font-size:80%'>What do we already know about the adverbs? They are words that modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs or even\
     whole clauses. There are several basic rules regarding where we should place an adverb in the sentence.\
     In many cases they can appear in more than one position (e.g. before or after the subject, at the beginning \
     or the end of a clause) depending on what  we want to highlight in the sentence.</p>", // OPTIONAL field, contains text to be displayed on the lesson's start page
