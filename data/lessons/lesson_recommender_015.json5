  text: "<p>There are dozens of <strong>journals that examine</strong> the relationships between film and culture. <strong>Films influence</strong> popular culture, group culture and just about everyone’s personal culture. If your professor or instructor were to name an abstract emotion, a major industry or a popular sport, you could probably think of a <strong>film that deals</strong> with that aspect of culture or society. Think about gender norms, religious sensibilities, economic inequality, gay rights, militarism, environmentalism, family values, popular history, patriotism, cultural violence, liberty, race, global technology, artificial intelligence or sheep farming. There is a movie for almost every group culture. <strong>Social issues often drive</strong> filmmakers, but they may also pursue stories about popular issues to attract the broadest possible audience. <strong>Filmmakers often balance</strong> the desire to highlight the social and cultural issues <strong>they care</strong> about with the need to make money in a global cultural industry.</p>",
