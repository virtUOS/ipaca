  text: "<p> What people eat and drink is one of the most important determinants of health as well as health equity. In\
  2019, poor dietary habits, overweight/obesity, and undernutrition contributed to 14%, 10%, and 5% of deaths in females,\
  respectively; and 15%, 8%, and 5% of deaths in males. Most of these diet-related health burdens were due to cardiometabolic\
  diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer. These diet-related conditions not\
  only reduce quality of life and productivity but are also leading risk factors for worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19.\
  Therefore, improving diets to reduce deaths, complications, and economic and equity burdens from cardiometabolic diseases\
  should be a global priority.</p>\
  <p>Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a priority concern given their relationship with obesity, CVD, T2D, cancer, \
  and dental caries; absence of any offsetting nutritional benefits; intensive marketing to traditionally marginalized \
  populations; and contribution to health disparities. Yet, for the vast majority of nations, recent national estimates \
  of SSB intake are unavailable, preventing an analysis of the evolving (and potentially nonlinear) trends in intake in\
  recent decades. Furthermore, prior global estimates have not evaluated SSB intake subnationally by important sociodemographic\
  factors such as education or urbanicity. This lack of evidence limits the ability to design and measure the impact of \
  interventions aimed at decreasing SSB intake, as well as the capacity to identify populations where such interventions\
  are needed the most.</p>\
  <p>In an investigation based on 2010 data, 184,000 global deaths were estimated to be attributable to SSB intake, \
  including 72.3% from T2D, 24.2% from CVD, and 3.5% from obesity-related cancers. Since that time, national and subnational\
  dietary data from a handful of high-income nations suggest that SSB intake has decreased in selected high-income Western\
  countries and Brazil. However, energy contribution from SSBs remains high in these nations; and SSB intake may be \
  increasing, based on limited national intake and sales reports, in non-Western countries such as Korea and India. More\
  recent, harmonized, and subnationally stratified data on SSB intakes are needed to inform intervention, surveillance, \
  and policy actions. To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated SSB intakes in adults aged 20+ years in 1990, 2005,\
  and 2018 in 185 countries, jointly stratified subnationally by age, sex, education, and area of residence, based on new\
  data from the Global Dietary Database (GDD).</p>\
  <p>It was found that intakes were higher in male vs. female, younger vs. older, more vs. less educated, and urban vs.\
  rural adults, and that variations by education and urbanicity were largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. SSB intakes increased\
  between 1990 and 2018 by +0.37 servings/week (+0.29, +0.47), with the largest increase in Sub-Saharan Africa, and an \
  overall decrease in Latin America/Caribbean. These new findings on global SSB intakes, trends, and inequities inform \
  intervention, surveillance, and policy actions worldwide, highlighting the growing problem of SSBs for public health \
  in Sub-Saharan Africa. </p>",
