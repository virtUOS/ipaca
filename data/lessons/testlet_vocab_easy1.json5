  text: "<p>What do you think is beautiful? Many of us may respond, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as the old saying goes. \
        [...] ‘the eye of the beholder’ is another way of thinking about the ‘theory of mind.’ One beholder thinks differently than \
        another beholder. When thoughts, values, and perspectives on the world are very common within cultural groups, we call them norms. \
        Norms about beauty are the idealizations and expectations of how people should look in a society: what ‘good looks’ are. \
        BTW, we’re focused on beauty norms for physical appearance but they also relate to aesthetic qualities of things [...].</p>\
        <p>Beauty norms or ideals for women often relate to facial and body features. Preferred characteristics become a shorthand for \
        femininity. There are also cultural norms that reflect ideals for the appearance of men and masculinity. For example, if you went \
        through an European or Euro-American educational system, it is very likely that you encountered imagery like Bust of a Youth by \
        Francesco Mochi from 1630-1640 CE. Artworks like this are often used to illustrate primary school textbooks or public flyers \
        because they exude many of the beauty norms of European and Euro-American societies. This marble sculpture represents a young man \
        with lush curly hair, a symmetrical face, straight nose, plump cheeks, large open eyes, parted full lips, and strong chin in clean, \
        polished white marble. With skill and precision, Mochi captured a portrait of a classically beautiful young man, according to \
        long-established beauty ideals of the Western Canon.</p>\
        <p>But, Mochi and other artists of the Renaissance and Baroque periods misunderstood something about Greek scultpure… \
        it wasn’t ever meant to be seen as bare white marble. It was lavishly painted with bright colors! [...] \
        Following from what Renaissance artists thought were Greco-Roman traditions, European beauty ideals often coalesced around qualities \
        such as light complexion, facial symmetry, and straight noses. White marble came to offer an aura of ‘whiteness’ and normalized the \
        relationship of whiteness to purity in the Western Canon and ideals of beauty.</p>\
        <p>Such images and expected ways of representation reflect how people view others in their society. We all know that people look \
        different and the vast majority of people in any culture do not ‘fit the mold’ of beauty ideals. Yet, we continue to set store by them. \
        These ideals influence art and they become shorthand for not just good looks but ‘goodness’ in a society, as the discussion about \
        the term “classical” in “Where Does Art Come From? An Introduction” demonstrates. What about global arts that do not fit the mold of \
        classical beauty but focus on unique traditions developed without reference to ‘the classics’ of the Western Canon? \
        This is one of the ways that art history has to reflect upon its biases. In this study of art, we are taking a global perspective and \
        so must affirm the ‘theory of mind of cultures’ and be aware of the ways that beauty (as well as gender, sexuality, etc.) is relative.</p>",
