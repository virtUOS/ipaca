  text: "<p> At what age should a child have social media? \
         So what age is too young for a social media presence? I interviewed a Freshman at The University \
         of Arizona to share her first experiences with social media, and get her take on how young is too \
         young. \
         Amara (a pseudonym) is 18 years old, and has an iPhone just like every other college student her \
         age, but the difference between her, and many other of these students is that she didn’t even have \
         a phone until she was 16 in her Sophomore year of high school. Amara’s parents were very strict \
         about phones and didn’t want their only child active on social media at such a young age, and since \
         the only phone she wanted was an iphone, where it is extremely easy to access social media, she \
         was not allowed a phone until she turned 16. This was difficult for Amara for a few reasons, the \
         first being she couldn’t contact her parents after school when they needed to pick her up, she \
         couldn’t talk to her friends outside of school, and she always felt very out of the loop. Vine was \
         very big the year all of Amara’s friends started getting phones and when they would all talk about \
         the latest videos she couldn’t participate in any of the conversations. Amara’s parents valued their \
         young daughter’s privacy over her social life, and at the time this upset Amara very much, but now as \
         she’s older she feels happy that she had different experiences than her classmates. \
         While other kids talked only through their phones, Amara had to meet up with her friends in person, \
         and she had to have the childhood experiences her classmates never would. She played outside, and did \
         normal kids stuff. This is why I believe that parents should wait as long as possible to get their \
         kids phones, because every child should have those experiences of making plans with friend’s in person, \
         and playing together outside of school. Kids need the experience of being kids, before they should have \
         any presence on social media. Amara’s parents were also worried of any harm that may have come to their \
         daughter if she had had a phone at a younger age. Cyberbullying is so common, and it is so easy for kids \
         to be mean behind a screen. Younger kids especially think it’s ok to say hurtful things over the phone \
         because they can’t see the other person, so they think it’s no big deal. Kids should not be active on \
         social media until they are mature enough to use it properly. Kids should enjoy their childhood while \
         it lasts, and then enjoy all the good of social media when they are old enough to appreciate it.</p>",
