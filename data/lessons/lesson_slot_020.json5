  text: "<p> Over the ages many approaches to understanding mental disorders have been developed that helped us gain \
  further insight to their etiology. The neuropsychosocial model combines some of these approaches by examining genetics\
   and biology (development of our bodies), psychological factors (personal experiences and perceptions in behavior,\
   cognition, and emotion), and social influences in the etiology of mental disorders. </p>\
   <p> In using the neuropsychosocial approach, it is widely understood by abnormal psychologists that each three factors\
   influence each other. This interinfluence is commonly known as the neuropsychosocial feedback loop. If an individual\
   is influenced by oppression, their neurotransmitters and hormones affect their psychological mental state, or if an \
   individual has thoughts that the world is going to end, these thoughts can prevent them from finding work, which\
   eventually affects their nutritional intake. Taking the neuropsychosocial model into account in understanding the \
   etiology and treatment of mental disorders provides researchers and clinicians tools in applied psychology.</p>",

  <p><b>In this lesson  you will:</b> \
   <p>Enlarge your background knowledge of approaches to understanding mental disorders \
   <p>Know about Dangling Modifier, which occurs when the intended subject of the modifier (which describes or \
   qualifies another part of a sentence)  is missing from the sentence, and another subject takes its place. \
   Basically, dangling modifiers often take the form of an introductory phrase that is connected to the wrong thing \
