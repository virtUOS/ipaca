    text: "<p>Many students find it easier to learn music theory when they practice a lot. In other words,</p>
    <p>physically creating sounds by playing a musical instrument (such as the piano) helps you to better</p>
    <p>visualize and listen to the music you are writing down or studying. This allows students to</p>
    <p>understand the relationship between different steps more quickly.</p>
    <p>When you sit at the piano, it is important to sit up straight, keeping your head over your shoulders,</p>
    <p>which should be kept down. Your elbows should be a comfortable distance from your body, and your fingers</p>
    <p>should remain arched (as if you were pulling a library book off of a shelf). Keep your knees and wrists</p>
    <p>flexible (not stiff), and keep your feet flat on the ground unless you are using the pedals.</p>
    <p>Learning to play notes on the piano is one easy way to be with music in touch. You may find access</p>
    <p>to a piano keyboard (acoustic or electronic) at your school. Another option is to download a free piano app</p>
    <p>that you can play on your phone, such as Tiny Piano. Notice that the keyboard has both white keys and black</p>
    <p>keys. The black keys are grouped into sets of either three or two.</p>"
