  text: "<p>Microorganisms represent the fundamentals of life and interact with almost every facet of it. Yet, for the majority of their existence they have been largely ignored, or rather unseen by humans. The unraveling of the complex interactions between all life forms is an endless duty and seems to generate more questions than answers. However, the cracks in knowledge produced by peering into the unknown offers insight into our life and the world around us. These minute creatures have shaped Earth’s evolution since their dawn almost three-and-a-half billion years ago, and continuously affect our environment and health. The importance of the planet’s collection of microbes is realized more and more each day, and our unceasing investigation of them will surely unlock secrets of life we could never imagine.</p>\
  <p>The study of microbiomes is fairly novel in the context of understanding and applying their communal existence to ourselves and surroundings. Though scientists have recognized symbiotic relationships and traditionally focused on individual microbes and their interactions with human health, environmental impact, industrial applications, etc., their respective communities and influence as a whole in these areas have only just begun to be elucidated. That is in no small part due to the daunting task of cataloging the immense and complex interplay between the multitude of different microorganisms in a given environment, though rapid advances in technology have begun to ease analysis.</p>",
