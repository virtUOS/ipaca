  text: "<p>Software systems are part of a world-wide economic system that has been rapidly evolving for several \
  hundred years; the factors driving economic growth are slowly starting to be understood. Analysis of changes in World\
  GDP have found cycles, or waves, of economic activity; Kondratieff waves are the longest, with a period of around 50 \
  years (data from more centuries may uncover a longer cycle), a variety of shorter cycles are also seen, such as the\
  Kuznets swing of around 20 years. Five Kondratieff waves have been identified with major world economic cycles, e.g.,\
  from the industrial revolution to information technology.</p> \
         <p>Until the early 1980s most software systems were developed for large organizations, with over 50% of US \
  government research funding for mathematics and computer science coming from the Department of Defense, an organization\
  that built large systems, with time-frames of many years. As customers of software systems, these organizations\
  promoted a customer orientated research agenda, e.g., focusing on minimizing customer costs and risks, with no interest\
  in vendor profitability and risk factors. Also, the customer was implicitly assumed to be a large organization.</p>",
