        question: "<p> Choose the option that applies:</p>\
        <p>The well-being and performance of office workers relies in part on satisfactory indoor environments. Delivering\
        comfortable and healthy offices is too often done in an energy-intensive manner, leading to increasing  cooling\
        demand globally. One way to reduce building energy consumption is to minimize heating, ventilation, and \
        air-conditioning (HVAC) usage, which represents the largest source of energy use in buildings.</p>\
        <p>Ranges of comfortable indoor temperatures are shaped by prevailing weather and differ across seasons and \
        climates. _1_. For example, the dominant standard for thermal comfort suggests a summer comfort temperature range \
        that is  approximately 1.5 °C warmer than the range in winter. Yet, paradoxically, indoor temperatures in US \
        offices have been shown to be lower in summer than winter. Similar overcooling practices have been reported in \
        tropical climates throughout Asia and the Middle East, and are forecast to increase in the future.  _2_.First,\
        office buildings with suboptimal HVAC design and control strategies for their local climates. Second, the most \
        popular model of human comfort for designing HVAC systems—the predicted mean vote or PMV model—tends to \
        overestimate discomfort in warm temperatures. Advocates for cooler-than-comfortable offices point to expected \
        performance improvements, but the empirical evidence  supporting that relationship is questionable. </p>\ ",
