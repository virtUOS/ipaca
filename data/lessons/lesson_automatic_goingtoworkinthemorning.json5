I have to wake up early every morning, as I\u2019m always in a rush. There\u2019s never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive.\r\nI usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it\u2019s not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CD\u2019s in the car \u2013 Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.\r\nThe drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer, maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.", text_source: "source invented", text_licence: "asdfas", text_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/backstage/lesson/automatic_create", tasks: [{name: "This is a name", type: "R", interaction: "SHORT", primary: true, show_lesson_text: true, question: " question: What is the name of the person who works at a large distance from my home?", answer: ["\u2019", " ", "v", "e"]}]}
