  text: "<p> Economics, and its offspring, Finance, are abstract (social) sciences. In order to study economics, it is\
   essential that one understands what an abstraction is. An abstraction is an idea, intended to mirror reality in \
   its simplest form. The world is a very complicated place; there are many variables or inputs, some identifiable, \
   others not, that affect an outcome, and which we endeavor to identify. In order to understand the outcome which is\
   generally true, but not necessarily absolutely or always so, one must engage in a process of simplification that \
   requires removing minor variables from a general idea in order to reduce the notion to its essential characteristics.\
   Indeed, the Latin word, “abstract,” comes from “drawing” or “taking away from.”</p>\
   <p>In this process, one is able to derive a broad, general conclusion, based on first principles from which is derived\
   a general idea or rule. In economics, this requires a ceteris paribus assumption, that is to say, holding “all else \
   equal.” Initially, it is assumed that no other variables matter and are thus ignored away. It takes some discipline\
   to do this at first, but it quickly becomes easy; you must merely keep it in mind.</p>",
