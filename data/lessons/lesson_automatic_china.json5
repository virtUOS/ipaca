  text: "Today China is one of the world leaders in the field of economy, which is mainly formed by the state. The Chinese authorities invest a considerable part of the budget in education, which can bring valuable personnel to the country. Thus, in 2020, China\u2019s spending on education amounted to $831.3 billion. Chinese education policy is driven by the need for literate, talented, out-of-the-box thinking people whose knowledge and skills can benefit the state, enhance, and strengthen its position on the global scale. The education system of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is based on the principles of social justice while guaranteeing equal educational opportunities for all children. In view of this, schoolchildren receive free education and students are allocated grants and scholarships. China willingly accepts foreign students expanding its socio-cultural boundaries and sharing experiences with other countries.",
