  text: "<p>“The Raven” skyrocketed Poe from infamous critic to famous poet. But the literary recognition of his arguably \
  most popular poem did not come with the paycheck one would expect. He only received $9 from The American Review for it, \
  and Poe continued to struggle financially for the rest of his life. Debt and alcoholism weren’t the only demons haunting Poe. \
  Death soon darkened his door yet again. In 1947, Virginia lost her battle with tuberculosis, devastating Poe. She was only 24 years old. \
  After her death, Poe’s dependency on substances grew until, in 1849, he died at the age of 40 under suspicious circumstances. \
  Some sources say he drank himself to death while others blame his death on drugs or rabies. No one is certain how Poe died, and it remains \
  a mystery to this day, not unlike the gothic endings of some of his most celebrated works. Poe may have beaten Death in the end; \
  his works are still recognized as an important part of the American Literature canon. Modern day readers have Poe to thank for \
  detective fiction, a genre which some credit him for creating. Best known for his evocative storytelling and his gothic style, \
  Poe continues to influence writers across the centuries from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Stephen King, who 616 Scott D. Peterson is \
  quoted in a Mystery Scene magazine article as saying of Poe, “He wasn’t just a mystery/suspense writer. Hewasthefirst.”</p>",
