  text: "<p>The structure of an organization is outlined in reference to how specific activities are performed to ensure the mission and vision of the organization are achieved. It also stipulates the flow of information within the organization. For example, does the information flow from the chief executive officer to the lower subordinates within the organization (top-down approach)? Organizations also allow the flow of information and decisions to be made between levels of the organization. Organizational structure includes rules, roles, and responsibilities. Organizations that have instituted structure can maintain their focus and efficiency in meeting their goals. There are three fundamental types of organizational structures: functional, multidivisional, and matrix.</p>\
  <p>The functional organization structure (also called bureaucratic organizational structure) splits the organization into departments based on the expertise of employees.</p>\
  <p>The matrix structure comprises the functional structure, along with a temporary project structure. One of the characteristics of the matrix organizational structure is the presence of two managers creating multiple reporting relationships. The departmental manager controls vertical relationships, while the project manager handles horizontal relationships. Employees are organized based on their function or services provided.</p>",
