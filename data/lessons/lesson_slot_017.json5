  text: "<p> A. Modern businesses seem to be so preoccupied with direct digital marketing strategies like social media \
  advertising, pay-per-click, and website creation but often overlook the impact that traditional marketing channels can\
  also have on conversion and organic search engine optimization. Most businesses today tend to stay away from traditional \
  marketing strategies because digital marketing appears cheaper. However, that does not mean conventional marketing\
  strategies are not effective anymore. In fact, traditional marketing strategies can also help you with your own small \
  business SEO efforts.</p>\
  </p> B. Your presence in the public square can create a good deal of buzz online. From the on and off-site promotion to \
  the brand mentioned by those that attend the event. With more and more people commenting on their daily lives, sharing\
  their experiences online - as well as their location - holding public events, exhibitions and shows, with your own\
  branded exhibition display stands, products and services, can be a great way to create brand mention opportunities that\
  wind up online and which Google will notice. This type of setting also allows representatives of the company to meet \
  with prospective stakeholders in-person and answer any questions they might have.</p>\
  </p> C. Telemarketing may be the most uncomfortable traditional marketing strategy to implement, but you can always hire \
  someone else to call people for you. To make telemarketing more successful for your business, you need to obtain a\
  high-quality list of leads. Make sure the leads are interested in the type of products or services that you are selling.\
  Most people will ask for a website as a validator. This enables you to direct targeted traffic straight to your site, \
  increasing traffic, time on site and page views, all of which can improve your site ranking. </p>",
