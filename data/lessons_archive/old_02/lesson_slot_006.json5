  start: "<h2>Focus of the lesson</h2>\
  <p><b>In this lesson  you will:</b>\
  <p>Re-order paragraphs to polish up your ability to understand the organisation and cohesion of an academic text\
  <p>Revisit your understanding of philosophical ethics\
  <p>Brush up your knowledge of Collocations\
  <p>Work on the word forms\
  <p style='font-size:80%'>Good to know: A collocation is a combination of two or more words which occurs repeatedly in text and can be instantly retrieved from memory by a competent native speaker (<i> Siepmann, D.,\
  Gallagher, J.D., Hannay, M., & Mackenzie, J.L. (2011)  Writing in English: A Guide for Advanced Learners, p.272 </i>.).\
  Collocations occur frequently in academic writing and speech.Knowing and using appropriate collocations can help to \
  improve the clarity, accuracy, and fluency of academic writing,and also convey a more natural and sophisticated use of\
  the language. Thus, an understanding of collocations is an essential aspect of developing proficiency in academic English.</p>", // OPTIONAL field, contains text to be displayed on the lesson's start page

         them to see which really provide the support we are after and which do not.'
