  text: "<p>                          New information and remaining uncertainties</p>\
         </p>  The key issue in predicting future rates of global sea level rise is to understand and predict how ice \
         sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will react to a warming climate. Current projections of global sea level\
         rise do not account for the complicated behaviour of these giant ice slabs as they interact with the atmosphere,\
         the ocean and the land. Lack of knowledge about the ice sheets and their behaviour is the primary reason that\
         projections of global sea level rise include such a wide range of plausible future conditions.</p>\
         </p>  Early efforts at semi-empirical models suggested much higher rates of sea level rise (as much as 6 feet\
         by 2100). More recent work suggests that a high end of 3 to 4 feet is more plausible. It is not clear, however,\
         whether these statistical relationships will hold in the future or that they are appropriate in modelling past\
         behaviour, thus calling their reliability into question. Some decision-makers may wish to consider a broader\
         range of scenarios such as 8 inches or 6.6 feet by 2100 in the context of risk-based analysis.</p>",
