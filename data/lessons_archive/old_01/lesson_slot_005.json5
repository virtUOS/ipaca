  text: "<p>It is essential to recognize that value is not just price. Value is a much richer concept. Fundamentally, \
         the notion of customer value is fairly basic and relatively simple to understand; however, implementing this\
         concept can  prove to be tremendously challenging. It is a challenge because customer value is highly dynamic\
         and can change for a variety of reasons, including the following: the business may change elements that are \
         important to the customer value calculation, customers' preferences and perceptions may change over time, and \
         competitors may change what they offer to customers. One author states that the challenge is to 'understand the\
         ever changing customer needs and innovate to gratify those needs.'</p>\
         <p>The simple version of the concept of customer value is that individuals evaluate the perceived benefits of\
         some product or service and then compare that with their perceived cost of acquiring that product or service. If\
         the benefits outweigh the cost, the product or the service is then seen as attractive.</p>\
         <p>Firms that provide greater customer value relative to their competitors should expect to see higher revenues\
         and superior returns. Robert Buzzell and Bradley Gale, reporting on one finding in the Profit Impact through \
         Marketing Strategy study, a massive research project involving 2,800 businesses, showed that firms with superior\
         customer value outperform their competitors on ROI and market share gains.</p>",
