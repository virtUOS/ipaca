  text: "<p>The New Right sees what it calls cultural Marxism - that is, Gramsci's theory that culture must be weaponized\
         against the upper classes - as one major danger. Many in the New Right feel that the culture has been weaponized\
         against all they hold dear, just as many in the New Left feel that society has suppressed their values and \
         principles.</p>\
         </p>English author and social critic Os Guinness, for example, places special emphasis not only on Gramsci but\
         also on German-American philosopher and political theorist Herbert Marcuse (1898–1979), who argues in his\
         1964 book, One-Dimensional Man, that the working classes have become immersed in consumerist culture and,\
         needing jobs to fulfill their consumerist appetites, have lost their ability to think in a revolutionary \
         way about their oppression.  Marcuse argued that growing movements in the 1960s for sexual liberation and for\
         more radical forms of social change represented the forces that could initiate a communist revolution, and he \
         advocated for dramatic cultural change. As UCLA professor Douglas Kellner remarks, “Marcuse championed . . .\
         minorities,outsiders, and radical intelligentsia [writers, professors, and artists] and attempted to nourish \
         oppositional thought and behaviour through promoting radical thinking.” According to Marcuse, this radical\
         thinking would galvanize calls for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism — a feat that the working class was \
         no longer able to effectuate. As a result, Marcuse became one of the most prominent champions of what in the \
         1960s was termed the counterculture.</p>\
         </p>Thinkers such as Os Guinness argue that the counterculture has come to represent the dominant ethos of such\
         prominent and now mainstream culture-influencing arenas as Hollywood and social media, which they see as \
         routinely mocking and belittling traditional values. Guinness views the use of this increasingly mainstream \
         counterculture as an attempt to effectuate Marxist objectives. Such a movement, Guinness argues, has created \
         only rapid cultural and moral decline.</p>\
         <p>Other members of the New Right use the term cultural Marxism more metaphorically. For example, in a May 2021\
         speech, the former attorney general for the Trump administration, William Barr, argued that critical race and \
         gender theory share with Marxism a divisive “us versus them” mentality and an attachment to social change  call\
         for a workers’ revolution. According to these social conservatives, these features make critical race and \
         gender theory a socially destructive force, just like Marxism.</p>",
