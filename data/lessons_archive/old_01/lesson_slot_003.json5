  text: "<p> Every country has laws regulating who can leave the country permanently and who can enter and stay.\
   In many countries, failure to comply with immigration laws is treated as a  crime, and a person can be sentences\
   to prison for violating the laws. Some countries welcome immigrants, while others actively discourage them. Though\
   the UDHR affirms human migration rights, many countries enact laws restricting the permanent movement of people.</p>\
   <p> There is an ongoing debate about changing the world to one of open borders, where people are free to move about \
   the world as they want. When there are open borders, there are no restriction on emigration or immigration, except \
   for safety and criminal issues. Emigration and immigration issues are complex, and society's acceptance of \
    emigrating and immigrating peoples varies widely depending on a country's political climate.</p>\
     </p> As climate change becomes an increasingly urgent issue, the implications for human rights will be a \
     growing area of political and legal debate. The UN is actively addressing the problem and has issued guidance \
      on the protection of climate change refugees, although the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) does not\
       endorse the term 'climate refugee' and notes that 'it is more accurate to refer to 'persons \
        displaced in the context of disasters and climate change'.</p>",
