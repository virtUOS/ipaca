  text: "<p> Many students find it easier to learn music theory when they practice a lot. In other words, physically creating sounds by playing a musical instrument (such as the piano) helps you to better visualize and listen to the music you are writing down or studying.\ This allows students to understand the relationship between different steps more quickly. <p> 
  When you sit at the piano, it is important to sit up straight, keeping your head over your shoulders, which should be kept down. Your elbows should be a comfortable distance from your body, and your fingers should remain arched (as if you were pulling a library book off of a shelf). Keep your knees and wrists flexible (not stiff), and keep your feet flat on the ground unless you are using the pedals. 
  Learning to play notes on the piano is one easy way to be with music in touch. You may find access to a piano keyboard (acoustic or electronic) at your school. Another option is to download a free piano app that you can play on your phone, such as Tiny Piano. Notice that the keyboard has both white keys and black keys. The black keys are grouped into sets of either three or two.
